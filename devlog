Day 1: 5/12/16
-added devlog
-Added basic framework of generation propegation into appropriate classes
	- added nextGeneration and propegate to Forest
		-NextGeneration finds the indeces of which trees are alive, and for each one that is, that tree is stored in a new forest along with the other trees around it
		-propegate is what runs inside nextGeneration- determines the indeces that each tree will grow more trees in, then uses the child method in Tree to determine whether something will grow there
	-added child to Tree
		- takes a constant growth probability, compares it to a random number, and returns a constructed tree similar to the surviving parent, with some random variation
	-added nextGen to Simulator
		-runs nextGeneration in Forest
	-edited the Draw method in GUI
		-every loop, checks for fire. If there is none, the next generation is called.
!!!!! bug notice: instead of continuing to next generation, forest grid fills with grey squares. Could be dead trees or simply empty.
!!!!! Bug FIX: was working on old versions of GUI, simulator, and tree. Updates in Forest were not reaching these classes. Now working in correct locations. Deleting confusing extra projects from workspace, keeping them as a backup somewhere else
